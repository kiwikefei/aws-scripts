# S3

Create an S3 storage bucket.

```typescript
import { S3Bucket } from "@pixelfusion/aws-scripts";

const assetBucket = new S3Bucket(
  this,
  stack.getResourceID('Assets'),
  {
    parameters: {
      publicPath: 'public/*',
      bucketAccess: 'Public',
    },
  },
  stack
);
```

The bucket has a `.bucket` property you can use to access
the exposed S3 bucket reference. E.g. to get the bucket name
after creation.
